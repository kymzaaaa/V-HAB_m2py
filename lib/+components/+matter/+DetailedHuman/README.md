All BVAD values refer to Table 3.26 in the NASA Baseline Values and Assumptions Document (BVAD) 2018

Values in produced humidity could be further adjusted to get closer to the BVAD value, which would also result in the urine production becoming smaller. For the moment however, values are considered close enough for the model to be usable
