Tutorials
==============

To run one of the tutorials, enter the following command into the MATLAB command window: For example the `simple_flow` tutorial is `vhab.exec('tutorials.simple_flow.setup');`. Once the simulation has completed (you will see this by the outputs in the command window), you can plot the results of your simulation by entering `oLastSimObj.plot()` in the command window.

Before you have a look at the tutorials you should have worked through chapters 1 and 2 of the V-HAB documentation from https://wiki.tum.de/display/vhab !

The tutorial with the most general information is the simple flow tutorial, which covers all basic V-HAB information. Therefore this tutorial is a good starting point.

For a basic introduction into the thermal domain view the simple_thermal tutorial and for a more advanced introduction into it the thermal tutorial.

For a basic introduction into the electric domain, view the simple_circuit tutorial.

The other tutorials cover basic components of V-HAB and basically repeat and enhance information from the wiki. You can use these whenever you want to remember how to work with a specific aspect of V-HAB. E.g. for manipulators you open the manipulator tutorial and for P2Ps you open the P2P tutorial. The commenting in the tutorials is focused on the aspect the tutorials wants to show, so in the P2P tutorial only the P2P implementation and the P2Ps are commented.
