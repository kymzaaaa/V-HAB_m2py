classdef Filter < matter.store
    %FILTER Generic filter model
    %   This filter is modeled as a store with two phases, one representing
    %   the flow volume, the other representing the volume taken up by the
    %   material absorbing matter from the gas stream through the flow
    %   volume. 
    %   The two phases are connected by a phase-to-phase (p2p) processor.

        % We want to log the flow rate through the p2p processor, currently
        % the only way to access the processor is by setting it as a
        % property of this store.
